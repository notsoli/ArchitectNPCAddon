Adds a new town NPC called the Architect. They sell building materials like wood, stone, dirt, and other nonrenewable or difficult to get materials.

Meant to be an addon to Helpful NPCs by Caseratis, but it can be used on its own without any issues.

For a complete NPC experience, I'd recommend combining this mod with Helpful NPCs by Caseratis and Just Another Alchemist NPC by CopperShortsword.
